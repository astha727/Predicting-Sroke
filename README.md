Title: Stroke Prediction â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning

Overview:
This project explores a healthcare dataset to predict stroke occurrences based on patient attributes. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning models.

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions, correlations, and class imbalances.
Model Building & Evaluation: Comparing Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision-recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Results:

Random Forest showed the best balance of accuracy and interpretability.
Feature importance analysis identified key predictors of stroke.
ROC Curve comparison highlighted model performance trade-offs.
